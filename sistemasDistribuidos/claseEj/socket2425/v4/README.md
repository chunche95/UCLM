Python Struct Functions

There are five important functions in struct module - pack(), unpack(), calcsize(), pack_into() and unpack_from(). In all these functions, we have to provide the format of the data to be converted into binary. Some of the popular format characters are:

?: boolean
h: short
l: long
i: int
f: float
q: long long int

You can get the complete list of format characters ([here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/struct.html#format-characters)). Letâ€™s start looking into struct module functions one by one.
